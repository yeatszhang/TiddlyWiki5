The `draggable` widget creates a DOM element that can be dragged by the user. It only works on browsers that support drag and drop, which typically means desktop browsers, but [[there are workarounds|Mobile Drag And Drop Shim Plugin]].

The draggable element can be assigned a list of tiddlers that are used as the payload. See DragAndDropMechanism for an overview.

! Content and Attributes

|!Attribute |!Description |
|tiddler |Optional title of the payload tiddler for the drag |
|filter |Optional filter defining the payload tiddlers for the drag |
|class |Optional CSS classes to assign to the draggable element. The class `tc-draggable` is added automatically, and the class `tc-dragging` is applied while the element is being dragged |
|tag |Optional tag to override the default "div" element |

Either or both of the ''tiddler'' and ''filter'' attributes must be specified in order for there to be a payload to drag.

The LinkWidget incorporates the functionality of the DraggableWidget via the ''draggable'' attribute.
